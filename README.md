## 🔬 Advanced Features

### Formal Logic and Belief Revision
The Logic Kernel provides sophisticated symbolic reasoning with first-order logic, modal logic, and temporal logic capabilities. It maintains knowledge consistency through belief revision, detects contradictions and paradoxes, and generates formal proofs of logical statements.

### Emergent Properties
Sully can detect and nurture genuinely emergent patterns arising from interactions between cognitive modules. The system identifies when new properties arise that transcend their component parts.

### Autonomous Goal Setting
The system can establish its own learning objectives based on interactions, knowledge gaps, and interest patterns, creating a self-directed learning pathway.

### Visual Understanding
Sully can process images, detect objects and their relationships, and integrate visual information with conceptual knowledge for comprehensive understanding.

### Continuous Learning
Knowledge continuously evolves through consolidation, pattern recognition, and transfer learning between domains, with no artificial limitations.

### Self-Improvement
Through neural modification capabilities, Sully can analyze the performance of its own modules and suggest improvements to its cognitive architecture.

### Memory Integration
The enhanced memory system provides episodic and semantic memory with emotional context awareness, enabling Sully to recall relevant past experiences and maintain continuity in interactions.

### Dynamic Identity
Sully's identity system enables adaptive personas, cognitive blending, and personality evolution, allowing the system to adapt its expression patterns to different contexts while maintaining a coherent self-model. The system can dynamically generate context-specific personas, evolve over time based on interactions, and transform responses according to different cognitive modes.

### Kernel Integration System
The Kernel Integration System connects Sully's specialized cognitive modules, enabling cross-kernel operations and emergent capabilities. This creates a cohesive cognitive architecture where different modes of thought interact to produce insights that transcend individual modules:

- Cross-Kernel Operations: Transform outputs from one cognitive module into inputs for another
- Integrated Narratives: Generate cohesive narratives incorporating multiple cognitive perspectives
- Concept Networks: Map relationships between concepts using multiple cognitive lenses
- Recursive Explorations: Perform deep explorations of concepts through different modes of thought
- Document Processing: Analyze PDFs and other documents through multiple cognitive kernels simultaneously
- Emergent Synthesis: Enable new capabilities that emerge from the interaction between specialized modules

The system integrates dream generation, concept fusion, paradox analysis, mathematical translation, conversation, and memory into a unified cognitive framework that's greater than the sum of its parts.

## 📊 System Status

To check the overall system status:

```http
GET /system_status
```

This provides information about available modules, memory status, kernel integration status, and system time.
